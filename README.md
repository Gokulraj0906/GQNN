# QNN: A Python Package for Quantum Neural Networks

QNN is a pioneering Python library designed for research and experimentation with Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). By integrating principles of quantum computing with classical neural network architectures, QNN enables researchers to explore hybrid models that leverage the computational advantages of quantum systems. This library was developed by **Gokul Raj S** as part of his research on Customized Quantum Neural Networks.

## Introduction

Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are an emerging field of study combining the principles of quantum mechanics with artificial intelligence. The **QNN** package offers a platform to implement and study hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical machine learning applications.

This package allows you to:

- Experiment with QNN architectures.
- Train models on classical or quantum data.
- Explore quantum-enhanced learning algorithms.
- Conduct research in Quantum Machine Learning.

## Getting Started

### Basic Example
```python
from QNN import QuantumNeuralNetwork

# Create a Quantum Neural Network instance
qnn = QuantumNeuralNetwork(qubits=4, layers=2)

# Prepare data
X_train = [[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6]]
y_train = [0, 1, 0]

# Train the QNN
qnn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test predictions
X_test = [[0.15, 0.25], [0.35, 0.45]]
predictions = qnn.predict(X_test)

print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

### Advanced Usage
